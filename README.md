# Introduction
My journey with Data Science started about 3 months ago when I undertook the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly in Singapore. The following is my journey for my final capstone project for graduation. The programming language used here is Python.

# Background
Since the founding of the first commercial airlines in 1909, humanity have come a long way in mass air transportation. With the emergence of multiple carriers serving similar routes, there has been an increasing need to differentiate and market each airline from its competitors. The paramount aspect of customer satisfaction is one such way. Social media has a growing influence on our purchase decision and should be taken into account by airlines management.

The analysis of Tweets is one such way to measure customer sentiment.

# Problem Statement
